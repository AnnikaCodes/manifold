        <Title className="pt-2" text="How Probabilities work" />
        <p className="px-2">
          The probability of a market represents what the collective bets of
          users predict the chances of an outcome occurring is. How this is
          calculated depends on the type of market - see below!
        </p>

        <Title className="pt-2" text="Types of markets" />
        <p className="px-2">
          There are currently 3 types of markets: Yes/No (binary), Free
          response, and Numerical.
        </p>
        <div className="px-12 py-3 text-xl font-semibold">Yes/No (Binary) </div>
        <p className="px-12 text-base">
          The creator asks a question where traders can bet yes or no. The %
          represents what users believe the probability of the event occuring to
          be. Check out our{' '}

          The creator asks an open ended question. Both the creator and users
          can propose answers which can be bet on. Donâ€™t be intimidated to add
          new answers! The payout system and initial liquidity rewards users who
          bet on new answers early. The algorithm used to determine the
          probability and payout is complicated but if you want to learn more

          Use your superior knowledge on topics to identify markets which have

        <p className="px-12 text-base">
          Similar to a stock market, probabilities can be overvalued and
          undervalued. If you bet (buy shares) at one end of the spectrum and
          subsequently other users buy even more shares of that same type, the
          value of your own shares will increase. Sometimes it will be most
          profitable to wait for the market to resolve but often it can be wise
          to sell your shares and take the immediate profits. This can also be a
          great way to free up Mana if you are lacking funds.
